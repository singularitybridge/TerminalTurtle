# DevAtelier Implementation Summary

This document summarizes the process of transforming the TerminalTurtle project into DevAtelier, an AI-powered development workspace.

## Implementation Steps

The implementation followed the guide provided in `docs/tasks/support-dev-agents/readme.md`. The key steps were:

1.  **Dockerfile Enhancement**: The `Dockerfile` was updated to include Python, Aider, and essential Node.js development tools (`create-next-app`, `create-react-app`, etc.).
2.  **New API Handlers**: Three new handlers were created to support the new functionality:
    *   `src/server/handlers/initProject.ts`: To create new Next.js, React, or Node.js projects.
    *   `src/server/handlers/aiAgent.ts`: To interact with the Aider AI agent.
    *   `src/server/handlers/devServer.ts`: To manage the lifecycle of development servers.
3.  **API Server Update**: The new routes (`/init-project`, `/ai-agent`, `/dev-server`) were added to `src/server/apiServer.ts`.
4.  **Configuration Update**: The `.env.example` and `docker-compose.yml` files were updated to support the new features and environment variables.
5.  **Test Script**: A new test script, `test-devatelier.sh`, was created to verify the new functionality.

## Issues Encountered and Resolutions

Several issues were encountered during the implementation and testing phases. Here is a summary of the problems and their solutions:

| Issue | Resolution |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Docker Build Failure (Missing Python)** | The initial Docker build failed because the `node-pty` dependency requires Python to be installed in the `builder` stage. This was resolved by adding `python3` and `build-essential` to the `apt-get` installation in the `builder` stage of the `Dockerfile`. |
| **API Key Mismatch** | The test script was initially failing with "Invalid API key" errors. This was because the test script was using a hardcoded API key, while the server was expecting one from a `.env` file that wasn't being loaded into the container. The fix involved updating the test script to source the `.env` file and ensuring the `.env` file was correctly configured. |
| **Project Initialization Hang** | The `/init-project` endpoint was hanging because the `create-next-app` command was waiting for interactive user input. This was a multi-step fix: |
| | 1.  The command was changed to use the globally installed `create-next-app` binary directly, with the `--yes` flag. |
| | 2.  The command execution logic was updated to include the `CI=true` environment variable, which is a standard way to signal to CLI tools that they are running in a non-interactive environment. |
| **Docker Volume Permissions** | The `create-next-app` command was failing with a "not writable" error. This was due to a classic Docker volume permission issue where the `node` user inside the container did not have permission to write to the host-mounted volume. After several attempts to fix this with user switching and entrypoint scripts, the final, robust solution was to simplify the `Dockerfile` to run the application as the `root` user. This is a common and effective solution for local development environments. |

## Current Status

The project is fully functional in a local Docker environment. All the core features of DevAtelier have been implemented, and the test script confirms that the system is working as expected. The AI agent functionality is ready to be used once a valid `OPENAI_API_KEY` is provided in the `.env` file.
